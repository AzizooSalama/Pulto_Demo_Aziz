# Pluto_Beamformer
DIY digital beamformer using ADALM-PLUTO

This is part of a video series where we use the ADALM-PLUTO rev C to build a low cost digital phased array beamformer.  Videos can be found here:

The python scripts here are the ones used in the videos.  I recommend using them with Spyder IDE.  But I'm sure other python IDEs will work--I'm just not sure how the plotting will turn out....
